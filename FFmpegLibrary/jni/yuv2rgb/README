This code provides optimised ARM code (and the C equivalents) for fast
conversion of YUV420, YUV422 and YUV444 code to RGB565.

For ARM platforms, use the ARM code, as this will result in significantly
faster results (due to no register spillage in the loops, improved
scheduling etc).

For other platforms, use the C code - this is deliberately kept as close
as possible to the ARM code.

yuv2rgb.h is the overall header. #include this.

yuv2rgb16tab.c contains the definition of the standard table used by
all the routines (and passed in as a parameter). You can use this, or
define your own table.

Future versions of this software may include routines to generate tables
with given weights.

The latest version of this software should always be available from
